# Functions,Tools and Agents with LangChain Project (Coursera/DeepLearning.AI)

This project explores the ChatGPTâ€™s function-calling capability and demonstrates how to build a conversational agent using a new syntax called LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for tasks such as tagging, extraction, tool selection, and routing.

Key topics covered include:
- Generating structured output, including function calls, using LLMs

- Using LCEL to simplify the customization of chains and agents for application development

- Applying function calling to tasks like tagging and data extraction

- Understanding tool selection and routing with LangChain tools, LLM function calling and  other capabilities.
